# Solar Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning


## Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning to automatically segment solar images, identifying key solar features such as sunspots, solar flares, coronal holes, and quiet regions. The goal is to accelerate solar event analysis, aiding space weather prediction and scientific research.

---

## Key Features
- **Automatic Segmentation:** Detects and segments sunspots, solar flares, coronal holes, and quiet regions from high-resolution solar images.
- **Multiple Approaches:** Includes supervised (U-Net) and unsupervised (Autoencoder + K-means) segmentation methods.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Provides both visual and quantitative analysis of solar features.
- **Flexible & Reproducible:** Modular notebooks for easy experimentation and extension.

### Scientific Background
- **Solar Flare:** Sudden, intense burst of radiation from the Sun’s surface, often associated with sunspots and active regions. Can disrupt communications and power systems on Earth.
- **Coronal Hole:** Dark, cooler regions in the Sun’s corona with open magnetic field lines. Sources of high-speed solar wind streams.
- **Sunspot:** Dark, cooler areas on the Sun’s photosphere caused by magnetic activity. Often the sites of solar flares.
- **Quiet Region:** Areas of the Sun with relatively low magnetic activity, appearing less bright and less structured compared to active regions.

## Dataset
- **Source:** High-resolution solar images from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
- **Annotations:** Images are manually annotated with segmentation masks for sunspots, solar flares, coronal holes, and quiet regions.
- **Augmentation:** Data is augmented with flips, rotations, and zooming to enhance training.
